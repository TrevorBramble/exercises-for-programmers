# Exercises for Programmers
Solutions for Brian Hogan's book, Exercises for Programmers

## Plan

I'm going to implement the solution to each exercise in a handful of languages.
Largely I hope to cover the exercises with Ruby, Go, Python, and Elm. Possibly
Haskell, Rust, or C occasionally. But those are stretch goals.

Each exercise has a few "challenges" appended, elaborating on the original
problem. I'm going to ignore this on the first run through, then revisit them
subsequently.

## Organization

Each exercise will have its own self-contained sub-directory within this
repository including a README to document the problem and related details.

Within each exercise directory will be sub-directories enclosing solutions, one
per language.
